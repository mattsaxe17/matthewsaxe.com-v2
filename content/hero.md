# Hello, I'm
## Matt Saxe.

<h3>I build modern <text-cycler :options="['software.', 'websites.', 'applications.', 'experiences.']"></text-cycler></h3>

I'm a software engineer in Dallas, TX. Unfortunately, I am currently not building any software for clients. I've been working very hard on some other projects though, so feel free to check back here to see what I'm up to. Big things are coming.
