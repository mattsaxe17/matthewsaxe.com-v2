If you know me, you know I have long list of interests. I'm passionate about fitness and martial arts, read often, like to cook, and have recently adopted an animal based diet. As you probably guessed, I also have a deep passion for writing software. From websites to FitBit watch faces, I am passionate about problem solving through the medium of code. It all started in 11th grade, where I taught myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript in study hall...

These days, I am a software engineer professionally. I am not currently taking any clients, but I have created projects for clients in the past. My experience extends from front-end design to servers and databases, and I love working with complex math, data structures, and algorithms. From simple websites to complex web apps, check out my <m-link new-tab href="https://github.com/mattsaxe17">Github</m-link> to see what I'm up to these days. (I am still very active on Github)

I'm always open to expand my network, so reach out however you'd like - I'd love to talk.
